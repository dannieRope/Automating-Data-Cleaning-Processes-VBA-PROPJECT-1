# AUTOMATING DATA CLEANING PROCESSES- VBA PROJECT

## INTRODUCTION

Before analysing data, it is important that the data is clean, meaning it is free from errors, null values, blank values, inconsistent data types, duplicates, and other issues. 
Data cleaning improves the quality of the data, reduces the time required for analysis, and helps prevent inaccurate conclusions.

  However, data cleaning can often be tedious, especially large datasets or dealing with data from the same source in the same format repeatedly. This is where automating the data cleaning process becomes valuable.
Imagine loading your data and simply clicking a button on your spreadsheet to clean it. 
This project outlines how to automate the data cleaning process using VBA programming, making it efficient and less monotonous.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
