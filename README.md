# AUTOMATING DATA CLEANING PROCESSES- VBA PROJECT

## INTRODUCTION

Before analysing data, it is important that the data is clean, meaning it is free from errors, null values, blank values, inconsistent data types, duplicates, and other issues. 
Data cleaning improves the quality of the data, reduces the time required for analysis, and helps prevent inaccurate conclusions.

  However, data cleaning can often be tedious, especially large datasets or dealing with data from the same source in the same format repeatedly. This is where automating the data cleaning process becomes valuable.
Imagine loading your data and simply clicking a button on your spreadsheet to clean it. 
This project outlines how to automate the data cleaning process using VBA programming, making it efficient and less monotonous.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Data cleaning process is a very important activity of a data analyst before analysing any type of data. If data is not cleaned, it may lead to inaccurate presumptions about data-driven insights and poor decisions will be made based on those insights.
Data cleaning can also be tedious and time consuming and boring particualarly whe dealing with large datasets the same source in a consistent format. This means the analyst would have to be cleaning same data anytime it comes in.
The repetitive nature of the task makes the data a prime candidate for automation. 

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

1. Develop a VBA-based solution that automates the data cleaning process
2. Eliminate common data issues such as errors, null values, blank values, inconsistent data types, and duplicates.
3. Enhance the user experience by allowing data cleaning to be performed with a simple button click within the spreadsheet.
